https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/installing-using-linux-tools/
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3-venv python3-pip

2. Install python 3.9 and create a virtual environment
(Instructions based on the second answer to this question on StackExchange, except adding the deadsnakes )

2.a Add the deadsnakes repo
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa
sudo apt-get update

2.b. Install Python 3.9 :)
sudo apt-get install python3.9-dev python3.9-venv

2.c. Find out where your python 3.9 is located by this command:
which python3.9
(Should be something like /usr/bin/python3.9)

2.d. Create Virtual Environment in the Home directory.
cd
mkdir virtual_env
/usr/bin/python3.9 -m venv ~/virtual_env/venv_with_python3.9
source ~/virtual_env/venv_with_python3.9/bin/activate

2.e Verify that you're using python 3.9
python --version
(should see Python 3.9.xx)

3. Update pip, setuptools, and wheel
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel


4. Install pyrealsense2
python3 -m pip install pyrealsense2



5.  If you want to switch back to python 3.10 version for any reason
deactivate

6. To switch back to the python 3.9 venv
source ~/virtual_env/venv_with_python3.9/bin/activate
